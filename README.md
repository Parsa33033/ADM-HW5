# ADM_HM5 - Exploring StackOverflow!

In this homework, we build a system that provides users with information about our beloved StackOverflow. Specifically, the implementation of the system consists of two parts:

* **Backend:** where you need to develop efficient algorithms that define the functionalities of the system
* **Frontend:** where you provide visualization for queries entered by the user

In this repository there is only one file, `main.ipynb`, that contains all the runned cells and the relative outputs for each request and all the functions that we have implemented.
