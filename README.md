# ADM - Homework 5 - Exploring StackOverflow!


In this homework, we build a system that provides users with information about our beloved StackOverflow. Specifically, the implementation of the system consists of two parts:

* **Backend:** where you need to develop efficient algorithms that define the functionalities of the system
* **Frontend:** where you provide visualization for queries entered by the user

In this repository there is only one file, `main.ipynb`, that contains all the runned cells and the relative outputs for each request and all the functions that we have implemented.

## Files and folders descriptions

1. __`main.ipynb`__:
   > This is the main notebook containing the answers to questions for the assignment
2. __`functions.py`__:
   > the py file containing all the functions necessary for main.ipynb to work properly
   
 
## Files to put in the directory of the project

### To be able to use the main.ipynb file, the three datasets have to be placed in the same directory:

1. sx-stackoverflow-a2q.txt
2. sx-stackoverflow-c2q.txt
3. sx-stackoverflow-c2a.txt


## Files to be created automatically

### When running the code, few files would be created as below:

1. timestamp.csv
    > contains the combined graphs in a single csv file
2. my_graph.pkl
    > contains the dictionary of the graph created with a certain time interval (Just created for future refrence and is not used in the code)
